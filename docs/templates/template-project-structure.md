# Template: Opinionated Project Structure (Nx Monorepo Example)

This template illustrates an opinionated project structure based on an Nx monorepo, incorporating principles like hexagonal architecture, domain-driven design for the backend, and feature-sliced organization for frontends. It aligns with the concepts discussed in `template-testing-strategy.md` and `template-tech-stack.md`.

Use this as a reference or starting point if your project adopts a similar architecture. The actual, project-specific structure should be documented in `docs/technical/project-structure.md`.

> **Why a dedicated server component?** (Example Rationale)
> Complex compliance endpoints, longâ€‘running jobs and SSR might belong in a standalone Node service or Firebase Functions so they can scale, share domain ports and be tested in isolation. This decision should be documented in an ADR for the specific project.

This structure is an example. The specifics of how `libs/` are organized (e.g., by domain, by feature, by layer) or how `apps/` are structured internally will depend on the project's scale and team conventions. Always document your project's *actual* chosen structure in `docs/technical/project-structure.md`.
