# Project Structure
- Fully understand project structure in [STYLEGUIDE.md](mdc:stylemorph/STYLEGUIDE.md) before adding libraries or creating new files
- Always update project structure in [STYLEGUIDE.md](mdc:stylemorph/STYLEGUIDE.md) when needed

# Creating new project structure
- Prefer `mono repo` where the `root folder` is mainly for `docs` and will hold both `frontend` and `backend` applications
- `frontend` applications are organized by `feature`, `pages` and `components`
- `backend` appllications are organized by `domain` and `feature`
