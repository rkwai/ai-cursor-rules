# Project Structure
- Fully understand project structure in [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md) before adding libraries or creating new files
- Always update project structure in [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md) when needed

# Creating new project structure
- Prefer `mono repo` orgazied by `feature`
- If a new structure is needed, fully understand the [template-project-structure.md](mdc:docs/templates/template-project-structure.md) before creating [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md)
