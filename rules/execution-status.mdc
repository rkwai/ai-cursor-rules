# Continuous Alignment and Risk Management

**Key artifact to produce/update:** [status.md](mdc:/Users/rickwong/Documents/GitHub/ai-cursor-rules/docs/execution/status.md)

Fully understand stories being worked on as they are tracked in [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md).

Provide a high level summary of every story that is actively being worked on and what the next step is.

At the top, provide a clear status of what was last worked on and what is worked on next.

Completed items should be updated in [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md) and should no longer be part of [status.md](mdc:/Users/rickwong/Documents/GitHub/ai-cursor-rules/docs/execution/status.md).
