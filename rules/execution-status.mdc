# Continuous Alignment and Risk Management

Throughout execution, ensure the team’s work remains aligned with the product’s strategic goals and proactively manage risks that could impede success. Ongoing alignment and risk tracking allow for timely adjustments before small issues become big problems.

Reference [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md) to see what work is in motion and report notable items in [status.md](mdc:docs/execution/status.md) and tag the owner found in [ownership.md](mdc:docs/execution/ownership.md).

- **Regularly revisit objectives:** Keep the product's key objectives or OKRs visible and review progress toward them in team meetings (e.g. mid-sprint or weekly) to confirm that current work is contributing to strategic goals.
- **Monitor key metrics:** Track important metrics (e.g. user growth, performance, quality) as development progresses, and surface any concerning trends early to the team and stakeholders.
- **Maintain a risk log:** Identify potential risks (technical, timeline, market changes, etc.) and maintain a living risk register, updating it whenever new risks emerge or old ones are mitigated.
- **Mitigate proactively:** For each high-priority risk, define a mitigation plan or contingency (e.g. spike on a tricky tech issue, add buffer time, alternate approaches) and assign an owner to monitor it.
- **Frequent alignment checkpoints:** Hold periodic alignment checkpoints with leadership or stakeholders (e.g. fortnightly project reviews) to report on progress and risks, ensuring continued buy-in and the opportunity for course corrections.
- **Be ready to adjust plans:** If objectives change or a risk materializes, be prepared to pivot the plan or reallocate resources, communicating these changes clearly to the team to keep everyone moving in the new direction.
