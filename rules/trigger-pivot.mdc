# Goal
- We want to ensure posterity for our product specs by creating pivot records and updating our current product specs
- Our current product specs are captured in [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md), and [features.md](mdc:docs/discovery/features.md)
- Look back as far as you can and in our conversation and summarize the key takeaways that should be added that is not already there

# Capture architecture decision
- Once confirmed, capture the details of this product pivot in `docs/discovery/pivots`

# Update docs
- Update [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md) and [features.md](mdc:docs/discovery/features.md) to reflect this pivot
- Add/remove items in [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md) and [status.md](mdc:docs/execution/status.md) as necessasry
- Update the other docs in `docs/discovery` as necessary

# Instructions
- These are core context documents for AI so they should be succinct.  Only add if valuable.
