# Features and User Flows

Reference the [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md) and map out the end-to-end user flows for each feature in [features.md](mdc:docs/discovery/features.md) to ensure a coherent and intuitive user experience. Understanding how users will navigate and interact with the product helps identify gaps and refine requirements before development.

- **Visualize key user journeys:** Diagram or storyboard the steps a user takes to accomplish core tasks (e.g. onboarding, completing a primary task, error recovery).
- **Identify touchpoints and decisions:** For each flow, mark all user actions, system responses, and decision points to ensure no scenario is overlooked.
- **Optimize for simplicity:** Verify that each user flow is as simple and frictionless as possible; remove unnecessary steps and clarify any potentially confusing interactions.
- **Collaborate on UX design:** Work closely with UX/UI designers to create wireframes or prototypes for these flows, aligning on how the product will look and feel for each step.
- **Validate flows with users:** If possible, conduct quick user testing or stakeholder walkthroughs of the proposed flows and prototypes to catch usability issues early.
- **Update requirements as needed:** Refine the product requirements based on feedback from flow reviews, ensuring the documentation stays aligned with the envisioned user experience.
- **Diagram flows:** Include mermaid.js diagrams for each feature.
