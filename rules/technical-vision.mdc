# Technical Vision

**Key artifact to produce/update:** [tech-vision.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-vision.md)

Fully understand the business context in [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md), [segment.md](mdc:docs/strategy/segment.md), and [kpis.md](mdc:docs/strategy/kpis.md) before filling out the details below.

## Understanding and Maintaining [tech-vision.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-vision.md)

> **Purpose (≤ 25 words)** — provide a “north star” describing how technology choices
> and architectural direction enable the business/product strategy over the next
> 2-3 years. A concise, forward-looking vision rallies engineers and orients
> investment decisions

---

## 1 · Vision Statement  
Write one crisp paragraph capturing *where* the product's technology should be in
the ideal future state—focusing on customer impact, not tool names
(“We empower <segment> to … by delivering a <quality> platform …”)

---

## 2 · Guiding Quality Attributes  
Select up to **5** “-ilities” (e.g., *testability, observability, performance,
scalability, security*) that will dominate design trade-offs.  
Explain *why* each attribute matters for the business model and KPIs

---

## 3 · Architecture Principles  
List 8-12 non-negotiable rules that every design & ADR must respect
(“Bounded contexts own their data”, “All external access via ports/adapters”) 

---

## 4 · Strategic Objectives & Measures  
| Objective (verb + focus) | KPI / Metric | Target Horizon |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| e.g., Reduce lead-time   | Cycle-time (idea→prod) | ≤ 3 days / 12 mo |

Link KPIs directly to the Balanced-Scorecard in [kpis.md](mdc:docs/strategy/kpis.md)

---

## 5 · High-Level Technology Choices  
Outline major bets (languages, cloud, data platforms, AI services) in bullet
form.  Reference the **Tech Radar** quadrants (Adopt / Trial / Assess / Hold)
for each item so readers see maturity level

---

## 6 · Constraints & Assumptions  
Note regulatory, budget, or legacy-system constraints plus critical assumptions
(e.g., “traffic x10 by Q4”, “team size ≤ 12”) that shaped the vision

---

## 7 · Solution Sketch (link)  
Provide a lightweight system/context diagram (C4) stored in
`docs/technical/vision_context.md`.  Do **not** embed large SVGs here to keep
tokens low.

---

## 8 · Long-Horizon Initiatives  
Bullet 3-5 technical features in `/docs/discovery/features` folder that move the system toward the vision (e.g., “Replace
monolith billing with bounded context microservice”).  Each feature must reference
an Objective/KPI above and an ADR ID once approved
