# Business Domain Definition

**Key artifact to prodate:** [domains.md](mdc:docs/discovery/domains.md)

Fully understand [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md), [segment.md](mdc:docs/strategy/segment.md), [kpis.md](mdc:docs/strategy/kpis.md), and [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md)

Pay extra attention to the [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md) before filling out the template for each of the domains.  Create the domain docs in `/docs/discovery/domains`.

# <Domain Name>  <!-- ver:YYYY-MM-DD -->

> *Purpose:* Establish the why, what, and how of this business/domain context—nothing more.  
> Keep each section ≤ 2-3 bullets so the whole file stays well under 500 tokens for LLM loading.

---

## 1 · Domain Type  
Core | Supporting | Generic — choose one (per Strategic DDD).

---

## 2 · Problem & Value  
Describe the customer or business problem this domain solves, and the unique value it provides.

---

## 3 · Responsibilities  
- Bullet key responsibilities (business rules, policies, workflows).  
- Exclude UI/adapters—those live in app layers.

---

## 4 · Key Entities & Aggregate Roots  
| Entity | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ExampleEntity | Encapsulates X rule | Aggregated by Y |

*(Add only entities critical for domain language recognition.)*

---

## 5 · Public Interfaces (Ports)  
List the commands/queries/events other domains may call or subscribe to.
