# Target Audience and User Needs

Clearly identify who the product is for and what problems it solves for them. Understanding the target audience ensures the product strategy focuses on delivering real value to the right users.

- **Define user personas or segments:** Outline the key characteristics of target users (e.g. demographics, roles, behaviors) and group them into primary segments.
- **Identify user needs and pain points:** For each persona, document their main problems, goals, and what they value in a solution.
- **Validate with research:** Use customer interviews, surveys, or market research to confirm these needs are real and pressing for your target audience.
- **Focus the value proposition:** Ensure the productâ€™s value proposition in [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md) directly addresses the core needs of the target users you've identified.
- **Prioritize audience segments:** If there are multiple user groups, prioritize which segment to serve first based on strategic value and ease of reach.
- **Team alignment on user understanding:** Conduct a workshop or review session with the team to go over the defined personas and needs, ensuring everyone shares the same understanding of the target users and their problems.
