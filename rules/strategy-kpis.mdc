# Strategy Communication and Resource Commitment

**Key artifact to produce/update:** [kpis.md](mdc:docs/strategy/kpis.md)

Fully understand the business context in [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md) and the target Customer Segment in [segment.md](mdc:docs/strategy/segment.md) before filling out the details below.

# Product-Development Strategy  <!-- ver:YYYY-MM-DD -->

> *Why this file exists:* Distil our product's strategic logic (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions) and tie it to concrete KPIs across the four Balanced-Scorecard perspectives. Good strategies pinpoint the key challenge, outline a clear approach, and prescribe mutually reinforcing moves.  Balanced Scorecards make those moves measurable and executable.  

---

## 1 · Diagnosis  <!-- core challenge -->
Describe the single most important problem or opportunity the segment faces.  
*Tips:* Summarise root-cause evidence from market or user research; avoid listing symptoms. (≈60 words)

### Key Evidence  <!-- core challenge -->
- Data point & source link  
- User quote / metric justifying severity  

---

## 2. Guiding Policy  <!-- strategic approach -->
State the high-level approach that will tackle the diagnosis and focus effort.  
*Tips:* Express trade-offs (what we **won't** do) and anchoring principles.

---

## 3 · Coherent Actions  <!-- what to build / change -->
List 3-5 reinforcing moves or feature themes that embody the policy.  
Each action should map to at least one Balanced-Scorecard objective (next section).  

---

---

## 4 · Balanced Scorecard & KPIs  <!-- concrete measures -->
Define objectives & metrics for all four perspectives for our product

| Perspective | Objective (verb + focus) | KPI | Target | Data Source |
|-------------|--------------------------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Financial | e.g., Grow ARR | ARR $ YoY % | T-% | billing db |
| Customer | … | NPS / Activation % | | surveys |
| Internal Process | … | Lead-time (idea→prod) | | CI logs |
| Learning & Growth | … | % AI-generated PRs auto-merged | | VCS stats |

*Guidance:* keep ≤ 3 objectives per perspective; targets must be time-bounded and realistic

---

## 5 · Assumptions & Risks  
Log critical assumptions the strategy rests on and major risks (tech, market, resource).  
Pair each with a mitigation or monitoring plan.

---

## 6 · Review Cadence  
- **Weekly:** Auto-check KPI dashboard; flag KPI drift ±5 % over 2 periods.  
- **Monthly:** Validate Coherent Actions against latest Segment & Canvas docs.  
- **Quarterly:** Re-assess Diagnosis using refreshed market/competitor data.  
Iterative cycles reflect best practice for scorecard-driven strategy execution
