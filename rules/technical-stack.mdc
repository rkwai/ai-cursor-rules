# Tech-Stack Governance

Maintain a single source of truth [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md). Update it each time an architectural or infrastructure decision is made.

- **Create on first use:** If [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md) is missing, generate it in the `docs/technical` folder
  ▸ *Overview ‖ Languages & Frameworks ‖ Infrastructure ‖ Data Stores ‖ DevOps & Tooling ‖ Decision Log*.
- **Log every decision:** Append a dated entry under **Decision Log** capturing *Decision, Context, Alternatives, Consequences, Owner* in `docs/technical/adr` folder.
- **Sync dependencies:** Reflect added/removed libraries, frameworks, versions in the relevant sections.
- **Link to ADRs:** Cross-reference any Architecture Decision Record files (e.g. `adr-###.md`) for full rationale.
- **Enforce in PRs:** Reviewers must reject changes to infra/config/code that alter the stack unless [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md) is updated.
- **CI guardrail:** CI should fail if Terraform/Docker/K8s/etc. files change without a matching diff in [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md).
- **Version-bump note:** When upgrading a core dependency, record previous vs new version plus migration notes.
- **Ownership:** Engineering lead ensures accuracy; all contributors update the file when introducing stack changes.
