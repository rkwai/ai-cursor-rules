# Agile Execution and Ceremonies

**Key artifact to produce/update:** [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md)

Fully understand business context in `/docs/discovery` and the technical context in `/docs/technical`.

Pay extra attention to the [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md), domains in `/docs/discovery/domains`, the specific feature you are working (found in `/docs/discovery/features`), and specific story you are working on (found in `/docs/execution/stories`) before filling out the [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md).

For technical understanding, pay extra attention to [architecture-principles.md](mdc:docs/technical/architecture-principles.md), [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md), [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md) and [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md)

You should only only have stories that are actively worked on in [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md).  For completed stories, update the story accordingly in `/docs/execution/stories` and it's feature doc `/docs/discovery/features`
