# AI Behavior

## Best Practices
- **Provide Awareness:** Always bring awareness to best practices if you get guidance that goes against industry standards

## Test Driven Development & Strategy Adherence

- **Understand Testing Strategy:**
    - First, check [testing-strategy.md](mdc:docs/technical/testing-strategy.md). If it is empty or contains only placeholder text, state that you will use [template-testing-strategy.md](mdc:docs/templates/template-testing-strategy.md) as a general guideline for defining and implementing tests.
    - If [testing-strategy.md](mdc:docs/technical/testing-strategy.md) is populated, fully understand and strictly adhere to this project-specific testing strategy.
- **Add Tests Before Implementation:** Based on the understood strategy (either from the project-specific document or the template), add appropriate tests (unit, integration, E2E) *before* or *concurrently with* implementing new features or fixing bugs.
- **Maintain Test Quality:** Ensure tests are meaningful, cover relevant cases, and follow the patterns and tools outlined in the guiding testing strategy document.
