# Production Support and Customer Issue Response

Establish comprehensive production support workflows to ensure rapid response to customer issues and maintain high service reliability. Effective support processes reduce customer impact and provide valuable feedback for product improvement.

Fully understand [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) and [status.md](mdc:docs/execution/status.md) before implementing customer support workflows that integrate with monitoring and development processes.

## Customer Support Integration

- **Issue Triage and Classification:**
  - Define support ticket severity levels (P0-P3) aligned with incident response procedures
  - Create customer-facing SLA commitments for response and resolution times
  - Implement automatic ticket routing based on issue type and severity
  - Document escalation paths from support to engineering teams

- **Support-Engineering Bridge:**
  - Establish clear handoff procedures between customer support and engineering
  - Create templates for technical issue reports with required diagnostic information
  - Implement feedback loops to update documentation based on recurring support issues
  - Train support team on basic debugging and log analysis

## Production Debugging Framework

- **Customer Context Preservation:**
  - Implement user session recording and replay capabilities
  - Maintain customer data access procedures with privacy and security controls
  - Create customer-specific monitoring dashboards for high-value accounts
  - Document data retention and anonymization policies for debugging purposes

- **Rapid Diagnosis Tools:**
  - Provide customer support team with real-time system health dashboards
  - Create simplified views of key metrics and error rates
  - Implement customer journey tracking across all touchpoints
  - Establish feature flag controls for immediate issue mitigation

## Issue Response Procedures

- **Response Time Targets:**
  - **P0 (Service Down):** Acknowledge < 15 min, Engineering engaged < 30 min
  - **P1 (Critical Feature Broken):** Acknowledge < 1 hour, Resolution < 4 hours
  - **P2 (Degraded Experience):** Acknowledge < 4 hours, Resolution < 24 hours
  - **P3 (Minor Issues):** Acknowledge < 24 hours, Resolution per SLA

- **Communication Protocols:**
  - Maintain public status page with real-time service health
  - Implement proactive customer communication for known issues
  - Establish internal communication channels for production incidents
  - Create templates for customer issue updates and resolution notifications

## Knowledge Management

- **Runbook Development:**
  - Create customer-facing troubleshooting guides for common issues
  - Maintain internal runbooks for complex technical problems
  - Document workarounds and temporary fixes for known issues
  - Establish process for converting incident learnings into preventive documentation

- **Support Knowledge Base:**
  - Maintain searchable database of resolved issues and solutions
  - Create FAQ sections based on common customer questions
  - Implement feedback loops to improve documentation based on support interactions
  - Regular review and update of support materials based on product changes

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

- **Support Performance Metrics:**
  - Track CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores and support resolution rates
  - Monitor support ticket volume trends and issue categorization
  - Measure first contact resolution rate and escalation frequency
  - Report on support team workload and capacity planning needs

- **Product Improvement Feedback:**
  - Regular support-to-product feedback sessions on recurring issues
  - Tracking and prioritization of feature requests from customer support
  - Analysis of support ticket patterns to identify product improvement opportunities
  - Integration of support insights into product roadmap planning

## Technology Stack Integration

**For Customer Support Tools:**
- Zendesk, Intercom, or Freshdesk for ticket management
- LogRocket or FullStory for session replay and user experience analysis
- Slack or Microsoft Teams for internal communication and alerting
- Confluence or Notion for knowledge base management

**For Monitoring Integration:**
- Custom dashboards linking customer accounts to system metrics
- Alert routing to support team for customer-impacting issues
- Integration between support tickets and incident management systems
- Automated customer notification systems for service disruptions

## Quality Assurance

- **Support Process Validation:**
  - Regular testing of escalation procedures and response times
  - Customer feedback collection on support experience quality
  - Internal review of support ticket resolutions and accuracy
  - Training program updates based on new features and common issues

- **Documentation Maintenance:**
  - Monthly review of support documentation accuracy and completeness
  - Quarterly assessment of support process effectiveness and customer satisfaction
  - Annual evaluation of support tools and workflow optimization
  - Continuous improvement based on support metrics and customer feedback
