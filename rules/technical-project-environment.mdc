# Project Environment Documentation

## Understanding and Maintaining [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md)

1.  **Assess [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md):**
    *   If it is empty or contains only placeholder text, state that you will use [template-project-environment.md](mdc:docs/templates/template-project-environment.md)` as a basis to create project-specific environment and CI/CD documentation.
    *   Proceed to define or update sections such as Onboarding (development commands), CI/CD pipeline, and relevant environment configurations, tailoring the template content to the current project.
2.  **If [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md) is already populated:**
    *   Fully understand its existing content regarding this project's specific environment setup, development commands, and CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Ensure any advice or changes you propose are consistent with this established documentation.
3.  **When setting up local or production environments, or making changes to CI/CD:**
    *   Refer to the (newly populated or existing) [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md) for guidance.
4.  **Always update [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md):**
    *   If you make changes to the development workflow, CI/CD pipeline, or essential environment configurations, ensure this document is updated to reflect those changes accurately.
