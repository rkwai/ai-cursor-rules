# Collaborative Planning with Design and Engineering

**Key artifact to produce/update:** feature docs in `/docs/discovery/features`

Fully understand [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md), [segment.md](mdc:docs/strategy/segment.md), [kpis.md](mdc:docs/strategy/kpis.md), [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md), domains in `/docs/discovery/domains` and features in `/docs/discovery/features`

Pay extra attention to the [prd.md](mdc:docs/discovery/prd.md), domains in `/docs/discovery/domains` and features in `/docs/discovery/features` before filling out the story template for each story for every feature.  Create the story docs in `/docs/execution/stories`.
