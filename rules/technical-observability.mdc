# Observability and Monitoring Documentation

**Key artifact to produce/update:** [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md)

Fully understand the [tech-vision.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-vision.md), [architecture-principles.md](mdc:docs/technical/architecture-principles.md), and [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md) before you follow the below to fill out the [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md)

## Understanding and Maintaining [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md)

1.  **Assess [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md):**
    *   If it is empty or contains only placeholder text, state that you will use [template-observability.md](mdc:docs/templates/template-observability.md) as a basis to document the project's specific monitoring stack, alert configurations, incident response procedures, and observability practices.
    *   Tailor the template content to the current project. Create actual ADRs in `docs/technical/adr/` for significant observability and monitoring decisions and link them in the documentation.
2.  **If [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) is already populated:**
    *   Fully understand its existing content, including the documented monitoring tools, alert configurations, incident response procedures, and any linked ADRs.
    *   Ensure any observability advice or changes you propose are consistent with this established documentation.
3.  **When implementing new monitoring, alerting, or observability tools:**
    *   A new ADR must be created in `docs/technical/adr/` detailing the decision, context, alternatives, and consequences for significant observability changes.
    *   The [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) must be updated to reflect new monitoring tools, alert configurations, or incident response procedures.
4.  **Always update relevant sections of [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md):**
    *   Reflect added/removed monitoring tools, updated alert thresholds, or modified incident response procedures.
    *   When upgrading observability tools, record previous vs new configuration plus migration notes.
5.  **Enforcement and Ownership:**
    *   **PR Reviews:** Reviewers must reject changes to monitoring, alerting, or logging configurations unless [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) is updated and corresponding ADRs are created/referenced.
    *   **CI Guardrails:** Ideally, CI would flag changes to monitoring configurations, alert rules, or logging setup if [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) and associated ADRs are not also updated.
    *   **Ownership:** The Engineering Lead ensures accuracy; all contributors are responsible for updating [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md) and creating/linking ADRs when introducing observability changes.

## Creating New Observability Setup or Making Significant Changes

*   If defining observability for a new project or making substantial changes, consult the guidelines and examples in [template-observability.md](mdc:docs/templates/template-observability.md) and the principles outlined in the (newly populated or existing) [observability.md](mdc:docs/technical/observability.md).
*   Prefer comprehensive monitoring with proper alerting and incident response procedures as exemplified in the template.
