# Goal
- We want to ensure posterity for our architecture by creating an ADR (architecture decision record) and updating our current architecture specs
- Our current guide is captured in [architecture-principles.md](mdc:docs/technical/architecture-principles.md), [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md), [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md), and [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md)
- Look back as far as you can and in our conversation and summarize the key takeaways that should be added that is not already there

# Capture architecture decision
- Once confirmed, capture the details of the architectural change and/or direction in `docs/technical/adr`

# Update main docs
- Update [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/tech-stack.md), [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-structure.md), and [project-environment.md](mdc:docs/technical/project-environment.md) as needed to support this ADR
- Add/remove items in [tasks.md](mdc:docs/execution/tasks.md) and [status.md](mdc:/Users/rickwong/Documents/GitHub/ai-cursor-rules/docs/execution/status.md) as necessasry
- Update the other docs in `docs/technical` as necessary

# Instructions
- These are core context documents for AI so they should be succinct.  Only add if valuable.
