# Business Model and Value Proposition

Define how the product will create value for both the business and the customer using the Business Model Canvas. A clear business model and value proposition align the team on why the product matters and how it will succeed.

- **Identify the business model:** Clarify how the product will generate revenue or achieve its goals (e.g. subscription, one-time sale, user growth for ad revenue, cost savings).
- **Articulate the value proposition:** Describe the unique value the product offers to your ideal customer profile in [segment.md](mdc:docs/strategy/segment.md) and how it solves their pain points better than alternatives.
- **Know your differentiation:** Specify what sets your product apart in the market (unique features, pricing, quality) to ensure the value proposition is compelling.
- **Set success metrics:** Define how success is measured (e.g. revenue targets, user engagement, retention) and tie these metrics to the business model and value delivered.
- **Document and share:** Summarize the business model and value proposition in your strategy brief or canvas in [business-model.md](mdc:docs/strategy/business-model.md), and review it with stakeholders for alignment.
